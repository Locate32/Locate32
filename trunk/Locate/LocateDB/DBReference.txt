              20h = Unicode charset
DWORD         how many bytes should ignored to skip the rest of header (i.e., the compined 
              size of the next seven fields, in bytes)
variable      a null-terminated string specifying creator
variable      a null-terminated string specifying description

DWORD         the number of directories





3. Format for root directories:

DWORD         data length (actual length = this value + 4)
BYTE          type: 0 = unknown, 10h = fixed, 20h = removable (e.g., floppy), 30h = CD-ROM, 40 = Remote (network),
              50h = Ramdisk, F0h = Directory

DWORD         the number of files
DWORD         the number of directories
variable      the first file or directory in root
variable      the second file or directory in root
...
variable      the last file or directory in root
DWORD         null (0)


3.1 Format for directory

BYTE          type and attribute, the compination of the following: 10h = file
              80h = directory, hidden = 01h, read only = 02h, archive = 04h, system = 08h,
              10h = symlink, 20h = junction/mount point
DWORD         data length (actual length = this value + 1)
BYTE          the length of directory name          
varible       directory name as a null-terminated string
DWORD         modification time (FILETIME)
XWORD         creation date (WORD if ANSI charset, DWORD if Unicode)
XWORD         last accessed date (WORD if ANSI charset, DWORD if Unicode)
variable      the first file or subdirectory in directory
variable      the second file or subdirectory in directory
...
variable      the last file or subdirectory in directory
BYTE          null (0)

3.2 Format for file

BYTE          type and attribute, the compination of the following: 10h = file, 
              (0h no files, 80h = directory), hidden = 01h, read only = 02h, archive = 04h, 
              system = 08h, symlink = 10h
BYTE          the length of file name    
BYTE          index to extension      
varible       file name as a null-terminated string
DWORD         file size (lo)
BYTE/WORD     file size (hi) (BYTE if ANSI charset, WORD if Unicode)
DWORD         modification time (FILETIME)
XWORD         creation date (WORD if ANSI charset, DWORD if Unicode)
XWORD         last accessed date (WORD if ANSI charset, DWORD if Unicode)







4. Notes

- All strings are null-terminated ANSI, Unicode or OEM (old DOS versions) strings depending on the 
  third field in the header (exceptions are mentioned above). 
- If creation/modification/last access date is older than 1.1.1980, WORD value is -2 (or arbitrary in versions before 3.1.10.8220)
- Briefly, to read file do following
1. Read header 
2. While next byte is not zero read root struct as follows:
	1.  Read fields (e.g. type, path, ...) 
	2a. If byte (after number of directories field) combined with 0xF0 is 0x10 
	    (i.e. (byte&0xF0)==0x10), following data is file struct. Read name, size and date fields.
	2b. If byte combined with 0xF0 is 0x80 (i.e. (byte&0xF0)==0x80), following data 
	    is directory struct. Read it as follows:
		- Read directory header (name, dates)
		- Read subdirectories (e.g. recursively) and files until zero byte is obtained
	3.  If byte combined with 0xF0 is 0x00 (i.e. (byte&0xF0)==0x00) read next root struct,
		otherwise read next file or directory structure (steps 2a or 2b).
